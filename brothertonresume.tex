\begin{ressection}{Overview}
  \resitem{Creative and motivated software/embedded engineer with a wide breadth of knowledge and technical skills.
           Over the past 15+ years I have worked on everything from embedded firmware, embedded Linux development,
           Linux Kernel drivers, highly customized Linux distributions, to Java Applications and Android development.
           I have experience with PCB design, test, and packaging as well as software development under the Agile
           development model. I have served as technical lead on multiple successful projects and have the skills to
           take a project from idea to a successful deliverable.  I have years of experience working with and delivering
           projects to government customers. I am constantly improving and learning new skills to get the job done.}
